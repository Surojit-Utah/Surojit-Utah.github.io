I am final year PhD student at the [Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/), The University of Utah, working with [Prof. Ross Whitaker](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~whitaker/). My research is focused on developing deep latent variable models (DLVMs), such as the VAE, with provable properties of the distribution in the latent space that find application in outlier detection and disentanglement analysis. I have developed a method to find the relevant latent variables in DLVMs that are sufficient to model a data distribution, representing the intrinsic dimensions of the dataset. In addition, I am interested in training deep neural networks with limited annotated data, and I have proposed methods to interpret biomedical and seismic images using Gaussian processes in the few-shot setup. Besides probabilistic modeling, I have worked on registering 3D scans (RGB-D data). During Ph.D., I had the opportunity to collaborate with researchers from ExxonMobil, USA, on multiple projects related to interpreting seismic images, such as few-shot segmentation, outlier detection, multitask learning, and Explainable AI.
